All that is required of the user is to use this repository, enter into node index.js, and proceed to fill out information about their team. Users are prompted to enter ID number, e-mail, schooling, name, etc. Once the user is done filling out corresponding information to the amount of team members they have, they can choose "I don't want to add anymore team members." Once finished, an HTML file will be created which can be opened in the browser to view cards of added team members! See example below :)
